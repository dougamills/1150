    JSON OBJECTS

        - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
        - The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript Object Notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only
        - JSON exists as a string â€” useful when you want to fetch data from a server. It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object if you want to access the data.

        - show them what JSON data looks like in browser ---> https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/
        - https://jsonformatter.org/ --- > paste in text from above

        - we will talk more about JSON data when we start working with API's
